### Simple Calculator ApplicationðŸ§®
This Python-based calculator is a basic GUI application built using the Tkinter library. It provides functionality to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The application features an interactive layout that allows users to input expressions, clear the screen, and compute results.

## FeaturesðŸŒŸ

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

2.Interactive User Interface:
Buttons for digits (0-9) and operations, organized in a grid layout for easy access.
A single-line input field to display the entered expressions and results.

3.Clear Functionality:
A "C" button to clear the entire input field.

4.Result Calculation:
An "=" button to evaluate the entered expression and display the result.
Displays an error message if invalid input is provided.

## How It WorksðŸª¶
1. Launching the Calculator:
Run the Python script, and a simple calculator window will appear.
The calculator has a display area (entry field) at the top and a grid of buttons below.

2. Entering Expressions:
Click the digit buttons (0-9) and operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to form a mathematical expression.
The clicked values will appear in the entry field at the top.

3.Clearing Input:
If you want to clear the input field, click the C button.

4.Calculating Results:
After entering an expression, click the = button to evaluate the result.
The result will replace the entered expression in the input field.

5.Handling Errors:
If an invalid expression is entered, the calculator will display "Error" in the input field.

## Code OverviewðŸ¤–
1. Button Layout:
Buttons are defined in a list (buttons), where each button has:
text: The label displayed on the button.
row and col: The grid position of the button.

2. Functions:
button_click(value): Appends the clicked button's value to the input field.
clear_entry(): Clears the input field when the "C" button is clicked.
calculate(): Evaluates the entered expression using Python's eval() function and displays the result. Displays "Error" for invalid input.

3.Tkinter Widgets:
The Entry widget is used for input/output display.
Button widgets are dynamically created for digits and operations, with specific commands to handle user interactions.

4.Grid Layout:
The grid system is used to arrange the buttons systematically for a clean and user-friendly interface.
